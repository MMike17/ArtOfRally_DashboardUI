## Usage

Press Ctrl + F10 to open the mod manager menu.\
Adjust settings to select the colors you want for the UI, its placement and its size.

By default, the mod hide's the game's RPM, gear and speed UI, and places the custom UI on the bottom left of the screen with white base, cyan rev and red pointer.

### General

- **primaryColor** : will change the color of most of the UI's elements.
- **secondaryColor** : will change the color of the rev jauge and of the gear indicator.
- **pointerColor** : will change the color of the rev needle.
- **uiOrientation** : will change the general shape of the rev counter.
- **xPositionPercent** : will move the UI horizontally.
- **yPositionPercent** : will move the UI vertically.
- **uiScale** : will change the size of the UI.
- **enableSpeedTilting** : will decide if the dashboard UI tilts with the speed of the car.

### Debug

- **disableInfoLogs** : will disable the mod's information log messages.
